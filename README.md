## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile first workflow


### What I learned

I learned a lot on the 'Position' property in CSS while building this project. I also had the opportunity to refactor my CSS code in the media query section of this project as seen by commenting out some of my code.



### Continued development

Practice, practice and more practice.
